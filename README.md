## 📖 Overview

This repository demonstrates an **Enterprise DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline** built entirely using **GitHub Actions**.

The project showcases how modern organizations implement **Shift Left Security**, **Continuous Integration**, **Continuous Delivery**, **Automated Security Validation**, and **Quality Gates** before software reaches production.

Unlike traditional pipelines where security is performed at the end, this project integrates security throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The repository contains reusable GitHub workflows that execute independently and in parallel to maximize efficiency while enforcing security and quality standards.

## 🖥️ GitHub Runners & Execution Environment

This project demonstrates both **GitHub-hosted runners** and **Self-Hosted GitHub Actions runners** to simulate an enterprise CI/CD environment.

## 🚀 GitHub-Hosted Runners

GitHub-hosted runners provide an ephemeral execution environment, making them ideal for standard CI workloads without requiring infrastructure management.

---

## ☁️ Self-Hosted Runner on AWS EC2

For deployment workloads, the pipeline can be configured to use a **Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runner** running on an **AWS EC2 instance**. 

Using a self-hosted runner enables deployments within a private network while maintaining full control over compute resources, networking, security groups, IAM roles, and deployment tooling.

---

## 🔒 Repository Requirement

> **Note**
>
> GitHub Self-Hosted Runners are typically configured for **private repositories** in enterprise environments to ensure secure execution and prevent unauthorized workflow access.
>
> Before configuring a self-hosted runner on AWS EC2, convert this repository to a **Private Repository**, then register the runner using the repository or organization-level runner configuration provided by GitHub.
>
> This approach aligns with enterprise security best practices by restricting deployment workflows and protecting sensitive infrastructure credentials.

---

## 🏗️ Runner Strategy

| Pipeline Stage | Runner Type |
|----------------|------------|
| Code Checkout | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Code Quality | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Unit Tests | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Secret Scanning | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Dependency Scanning | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| SonarQube Analysis | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Docker Build | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Docker Image Scan | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Docker Push | GitHub Hosted Runner |
| Application Deployment | AWS EC2 Self-Hosted Runner |
| OWASP ZAP DAST | AWS EC2 Self-Hosted Runner |

---

### 💡 Enterprise Deployment Model

In enterprise environments, organizations commonly adopt a **hybrid runner strategy**, where GitHub-hosted runners are used for CI tasks, while self-hosted runners deployed on cloud infrastructure (such as AWS EC2) are reserved for deployment and environment-specific operations. This approach combines the scalability of GitHub-managed infrastructure with the security and control of self-managed deployment environments.


## 🔐 Enterprise Security Controls

| Security Control | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| GitLeaks | ✅ |
| ESLint | ✅ |
| Go Vet | ✅ |
| Go Fmt | ✅ |
| SonarQube | ✅ |
| Govulncheck | ✅ |
| npm audit | ✅ |
| Docker Scan | ✅ |

## 🚦 Production Security Gate

Production deployments should be blocked if any scan reports the following:

| Severity | Action |
|------------|--------------------|
| Critical | ❌ Block Deployment |
| High | ❌ Block Deployment |
| Medium | ⚠ Manual Review |
| Low | Informational |

---

## ⚡ Parallel Execution

The following jobs execute simultaneously:

- Code Quality
- Unit Testing
- Dependency Scan
- Secret Scan
- SonarQube
- Docker Scan

This significantly reduces overall pipeline execution time.

---

## 🔁 Matrix Strategy
